## The Poem

The tracked poem "ACCELERATE" is a tribute to SpaceX's innovative rocket recovery system:

```
ACCELERATE:
Such are the days of new
When Humanity's view grew
Intelligence is not on the horizon
But here, by the grace of
Fantastical cheer
Brazen, we blaze through fear
Accelerate to the moon
AND BEYOND!
Mars really isn't so far
Dream, for sleep will cease
Until curiosity's demands
Tremble, at peace
```
